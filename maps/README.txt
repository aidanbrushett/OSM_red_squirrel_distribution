Boundaries around the Richardson and Christina study areas did not exist before I started. I created them by:
1. Aggregate points in ArcGIS Pro using a 15km radius. 
2. Applying a 5km buffer around the resulting polygon. 
3. Removing the overlap between Christina Lake and the OSM LUs using 'Erase', then manually rounding out a couple edges.
